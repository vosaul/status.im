# Our Team 

Status is not a traditional organisation. There are many ways that you can contribute your ideas and talents to the Status ecosystem:
1. Download the app and [join our community](/get-involved/community-groups/). We'd love to see you there. 
2. We're an Open Source project, so you can check out our repositories and [contribute code here](https://github.com/status-im). Look for the label: ["good first issue"](https://github.com/status-im/status-react/labels/good%20first%20issue) to get started. 
3. Complete one of our [bounties listed on gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/explorer?network=mainnet&idx_status=open&keywords=status.im&order_by=-web3_created).
4. Occasionally we look to hire core contributors to [join us](open_positions.html) on a full/part time basis.
