# Where We're All Headed

**Status is not a traditional organisation.** We don't have hierarchy, there are no offices and no managers. We're all here to achieve our mission, and we have the freedom to choose how we do it.

Our aspiration is to be a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). There's no absolute view on what that future will look like, but it's important you know where we're headed. Under a DAO there will still be lots of work to do, and you'll still get paid for doing it - but the governance model of how Status will run will be different. As part of our community, you'll be in the exciting position to help inform and build the future of Status, and the DAO.  

Our future is very much in crypto. Right now, we ask that contributors receive their expenses in crypto and very soon we're asking that they receive a portion of their salary in crypto too. Eventually, all contributors will receive their entire salary in crypto.
